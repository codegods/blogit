## Contributing

As a free software, we are always welcoming to contributions.
But as of now, the software is more of a school project than a free software.
Consequently, we will be unable to merge pull requests until we present it to the board ( that'd be by late January ).
But that shouldn't be a reason to stop, because at the end of the day this ***is*** a free software.
We will soon start accepting pull requests, but that doesn't mean that you can't work on it.
It only means that we won't be able to merge it as early as we want to.

You can always help us improve by opening a [feature request](htps://github.com/codegods/blogit/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) or creating a [bug report](https://github.com/codegods/blogit/issues/new/choose)
